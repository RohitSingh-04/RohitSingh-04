Iâ€™m a final-year BCA student with a strong academic record (8.8 CGPA) and hands-on experience in backend development, Agile methodologies, and building real-world applications. During my internship at Infosys Springboard, I worked as a Python Backend Developer for a fashion e-commerce platform, and later took on the role of Scrum Master â€” successfully leading sprint planning, ensuring timely deliverables, and improving team productivity.

Iâ€™ve built and contributed to several projects, including:

ðŸŽµ A music player built with Django, deployed on AWS EC2

ðŸ§­ FindMyClass â€“ a JavaScript-based tool to help students navigate campus

ðŸ“„ A resume builder developed using Django (code available on GitHub)

Currently, Iâ€™m focused on developing my skills in Machine Learning, with a goal of applying data-driven solutions to real-world challenges. Iâ€™m passionate about creating impactful tech and collaborating with forward-thinking teams.
